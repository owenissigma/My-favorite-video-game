           <p>  Also known as "siege" this would have to be my favorite videogame. It is a very complex fps game that relys on sound queues and "game sense" or knowing how the maps are laid out and memorizing where common spots for players to be at. Theres different game modes for different tyopes of players. </p>

            <p class="title"> Quick Match

            <p>
              Quick Match is normally for either warm-ups or for players who haven't unlocked ranked yet. Quick Match as it states in the name is a quick match that goes up to 5 rounds and ends when 3 rounds are won. This game mode is most commonly used for lower to low-medium skill level players.

                Arcade is mainly and most widley used for warm-ups for ranked but can also just be played to have a fun time to mess around with friends with the many mini-games that are within that game mode and they are still adding more new mini-games. They have many fun mini-games such as snipers only which is pretty self-explanatory everyone gets the same amount of health and snipers and it is formatted like a team deathmatch where it's a race to get a certain number of eliminations. They also have a game mode called "golden gun" and that is where everyone gets a one shot golden pistol and its a free for all. There are many more gamemodes avaliable and many more to come.

            <p class="title"> Ranked

            </p>
            <p>
                Ranked is by far the most popular but consequently the most difficult game mode. This is also my favorite gamemode and is the most competitive. It consits of 9 rounds but can end when 4 rounds are won. There are special occasions where both teams are tied 3-3 and that enables overtime and then the game will not end until one team gets to 5 rounds won. There are 8 different ranks in siege copper,bronze,silver,gold,platinum,emerald,diamond,champion. After you hit champion you can keep playing and you can get wgats called "numbered champ" which just means you are a top champ so for example if in your champion rank you have the number 4038 then that means you are number 4038th champ in the whole world and that is very hard to do. It's very hard to hit just champion in general. The game has evolved an immense amount. There used to not be a champion rank and it used to only go up to diamond but, people got so good at the game they had to add a new rank so they could get the best of the best players into one rank.
